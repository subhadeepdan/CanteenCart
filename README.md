# CanteenCart
 The Project “Automated Canteen Management System” enables the end users to register online, read and select the food from e-menu card and order food online by just selecting the food that the user want to have using android application. The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear on the screen near the Chef who is going to cook the food for you. The system is the combination of Android as well as Web Application. The benefit of this is that if you want your order on your doorstep or want a takeaway from canteen then you can do it online by using this application. The user will have a username and a password, by using which they can login into the system. This implies that the customer is the regular user of the Canteen.
